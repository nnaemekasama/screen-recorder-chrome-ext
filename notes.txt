KEY PARTIES OF A CHROME EXTENSION
popup.js <---> tab (content script) <---> background.js script


For the extension task:
The extension has it's own UI that you'll develop and integrate using Chrome extension APIs... then the site is a standlone application that you'll create separately but the backend will link them.
The extension records videos and sends it to the backend (for storage), then the web app can retrieve those videos from the backend and show it to users. (edited)
